# Expense Tracker Application ðŸ’¸ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the **Expense Tracker Application**, part of my **30 Days 30 Projects Challenge**. This app allows users to manage their expenses by adding, editing, and deleting expense items, while also displaying the total expenses. The application uses local storage to persist the data, so users can track their expenses across sessions.

## Features

- **Add, Edit, and Delete Expenses**: Easily manage your expenses by adding, editing, and removing items.
- **Display Total Expenses**: Automatically calculates and displays the total amount of all expenses.
- **Persistent Storage**: Expenses are stored in the browser's local storage, so the data is saved even when the page is refreshed.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building full-stack web applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design.
- **shadcn/ui**: Beautifully designed Tailwind CSS components for a polished interface.
- **Vercel**: Used for deploying the Next.js application, providing fast and reliable hosting.
